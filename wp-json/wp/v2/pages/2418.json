Bright Chrome is generally found after a nickel deposit. This treatment offers corrosion resistance, wear resistance, high temperature tolerance, and aesthetic appeal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Nickel Plating Types:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-family: open sans; font-size: 14px; color: #3a3a3a;\">\n<li>Nickel (Semi-Bright)<\/li>\n<li>Nickel (Tri-Nickel)<\/li>\n<li>Bright Nickel plating<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Electroless Nickel<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">It is a dip technique used in aerospace, industrial, and defence applications to impart exceptional hardness and wear resistance.<\/p>\n<h4>Plating in Zinc and Zinc Alloys<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Zinc plating is a corrosion-resistant and beautiful finish. It&#8217;s frequently used to polish iron and steel items. Compared to Hot Dip Galvanizing, Zinc Plating provides a number of advantages.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">US Automation offers the following zinc plating plants:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-family: open sans; font-size: 14px; color: #3a3a3a;\">\n<li>Zinc (acid)<\/li>\n<li>Zinc (alkaline)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">US Automation offers the following zinc alloy plating plants:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-family: open sans; font-size: 14px; color: #3a3a3a;\">\n<li>Nickel Zinc<\/li>\n<li>Zinc Alkaline Iron<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Bright Chrome Plating<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">A layer of Chrome put over nickel plated components is referred to as Bright Chrome. Bright chrome is typically used for ornamental purposes.<\/p>\n<h4>Hard Chrome Plating<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Hard chrome plating is a common method for creating hard, abrasion-resistant surfaces. Hard Chrome deposits are thicker and are usually applied without pre-etching directly to the base metal. Rollers, hydraulic shafts, shock absorbers, and other items are commonly plated.<\/p>\n<h4>Copper Plating<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Copper plating has two uses: it can be brilliant or dull, and it can be used for both decorative and industrial purposes. Copper plating may be used in a range of aesthetic applications due to its distinct colour.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">US Automation mainly offer two types of Copper Plating:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-family: open sans; font-size: 14px; color: #3a3a3a;\">\n<li>Copper plating using cyanide<\/li>\n<li>Copper Plating in Acid<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Gold Plating<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Gold plating is mostly used as a decorative coating for jewellery, flatware, and other items. A thicker deposit of gold is employed using the cyanide process for applications where wear resistance is required. Because of its special qualities, gold plating is also used in the electronics industry, such as by US Automationproducers.<\/p>\n<h4>Silver Plating<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Depending on the ornamental or practical purposes, silver plating can be produced as a soft matte or a harsh brilliant finish. Silver plating is widely utilised in the ornamental, cutlery, and jewellery industries due to its attractive appearance. Silver plating is used for industrial purposes as well as decorative uses because of its conductive characteristics. It is used in switchgear components as well as aluminium.<\/p>\n<h4>Tin<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Electroplated Tin is commonly employed as a protective coating on ferrous and non-ferrous metals, both dull and bright. One of its main applications is the tin plating of busbar for electrical purposes. Tin alloys that have been electroplated are frequently employed in aesthetic and industrial applications. After nickel and copper plating, acid tin plating is sometimes used.<\/p>\n<h4>Lead-Tin<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">US Automation provides lead Tin plating plants for applications such as Tin plating.<\/p>\n<h4>Cadmium<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Cadmium plating is a cyanide-based procedure that is typically applied in matte and bright finishes when a pleasing look and corrosion resistance are desired. Cadmium coating gave iron and steel good protection. Its uses include marine, aerospace, and defence-related equipment.<\/p>\n<h4>Plating on Plastics<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">This is a term used to describe plating on modern synthetic polymers like ABS. This type of polymer has a high level of adhesion. Electroplated plastics are durable and corrosion-resistant and are utilised in a variety of automotive applications, including interior trims, handles, grilles, and knobs, among others. Nickel Chrome is used, with extensive pretreatment operations on ABS to make it conductive.<\/p>\n<h4>Anodizing<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">To meet our customers&#8217; ever-changing needs, We, at US Automation conceptualises, designs, manufactures, and instals anodizing plants.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Anodizing, also known as anodic oxidation, is an electrochemical oxidation process that generates a protective layer of Aluminium Oxide on the components&#8217; surfaces. It&#8217;s widely used in the aerospace industry to coat aluminium with a protective and corrosion-resistant layer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Anodizing protects components from moisture and dust, increases component hardness, improves abrasion, wear, and corrosion resistance, and gives the part an attractive surface.<\/p>\n<h4>Phosphating<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Phosphating Plants are conceptualised, designed, manufactured, and installed by US Automation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Phosphate conversion coating is a chemical treatment that applies a thin layer of zinc or manganese phosphates to steel items to provide corrosion resistance, lubrication, or as a foundation for further coatings.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Phosphate Coatings have a wide range of uses in the manufacturing business, including as a tool for mechanical production and surface finishing. Phosphate coating is also used in the aerospace industry for corrosion prevention and wear reduction on components.<\/p>\n<h4>Pickling<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Pickling Plants are conceptualised, designed, manufactured, and installed by US Automation on a turnkey basis.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Pickling is a technique that uses acids to remove scales and oxides from the surface of steel before further processing such as cold rolling, drawing, or shaping. When steel cools after being hot rolled, oxygen in the air reacts with the iron to generate scale.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Scale is brittle and difficult to remove off the surface due to its nature. Steel pickling is the most common procedure for removing scales in steel manufacturing.<br \/>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row full_width=&#8221;stretch_row&#8221; overlay_dotted=&#8221;&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1650020586151{margin-top: 30px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2862&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Rack Plating Plant&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h4|text_align:center|color:%23232323&#8243; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Raleway%3A100%2C200%2C300%2Cregular%2C500%2C600%2C700%2C800%2C900|font_style:700%20bold%20regular%3A700%3Anormal&#8221; link=&#8221;url:https%3A%2F%2Felectroplatingplants.com%2Fproduct%2Frack-plant%2F|target:_blank&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2858&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Barrel Plating Plant&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h4|text_align:center|color:%23232323&#8243; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Raleway%3A100%2C200%2C300%2Cregular%2C500%2C600%2C700%2C800%2C900|font_style:700%20bold%20regular%3A700%3Anormal&#8221; link=&#8221;url:https%3A%2F%2Felectroplatingplants.com%2Fproduct%2Fbarrel-plant%2F|target:_blank&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2726&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Combined Barrel &amp; Basket Plant&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h4|text_align:center|color:%23232323&#8243; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Raleway%3A100%2C200%2C300%2Cregular%2C500%2C600%2C700%2C800%2C900|font_style:700%20bold%20regular%3A700%3Anormal&#8221; link=&#8221;url:https%3A%2F%2Felectroplatingplants.com%2Fproduct%2Fcombined-barrel-basket-plant%2F|target:_blank&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row full_width=&#8221;stretch_row&#8221; overlay_dotted=&#8221;&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1650020586151{margin-top: 30px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2906&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Combined Rack Barrel Plant&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h4|text_align:center|color:%23232323&#8243; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Raleway%3A100%2C200%2C300%2Cregular%2C500%2C600%2C700%2C800%2C900|font_style:700%20bold%20regular%3A700%3Anormal&#8221; link=&#8221;url:https%3A%2F%2Felectroplatingplants.com%2Fproduct%2Fcombined-rack-barrel-plant%2F|target:_blank&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2231&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Semi Automatic Plating Plant&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h4|text_align:center|color:%23232323&#8243; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Raleway%3A100%2C200%2C300%2Cregular%2C500%2C600%2C700%2C800%2C900|font_style:700%20bold%20regular%3A700%3Anormal&#8221; link=&#8221;url:https%3A%2F%2Felectroplatingplants.com%2Fproduct%2Fsemi-automatic-plant%2F|target:_blank&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2226&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Manual Plating Plant&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h4|text_align:center|color:%23232323&#8243; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Raleway%3A100%2C200%2C300%2Cregular%2C500%2C600%2C700%2C800%2C900|font_style:700%20bold%20regular%3A700%3Anormal&#8221; link=&#8221;url:https%3A%2F%2Felectroplatingplants.com%2Fproduct%2Fmanual-plant%2F|target:_blank&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row full_width=&#8221;stretch_row_content_no_spaces&#8221; overlay_dotted=&#8221;&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1650360464153{margin-top: -100px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3094&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1653284541485{margin-top: 25px !important;margin-bottom: 25px !important;}&#8221;] Surface Coating Plants are typically used to finish metal and plated products.
