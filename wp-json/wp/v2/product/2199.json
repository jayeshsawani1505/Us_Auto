It is used for a range of purposes depending on its design, including collecting fats, oils, and greases in wastewater treatment in various sectors, treating oily water, removing oil from machine tool coolants, and aqueous parts washers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">The use of oil skimmers to pre-treat effluent reduces the overall load on the ETP system and lowers the cost of cleaning the effluent. Skimmers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, including Belt, Drum, and Disk.<\/p>\n<h3>Tube Settler<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">The Tube Settler System is a viable alternative to traditional sedimentation methods.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Tube Settlers are commonly employed to mechanically extract solid particles or suspended solids from liquids for clarifying. It&#8217;s also used to remove materials that have been deposited via sedimentation on a continual basis. Sludge is made up of concentrated pollutants that are released from the tank&#8217;s bottom.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Coagulation and flocculation reagents are given to the water before it enters the settler, allowing the solids in the settler to be separated more efficiently and simply, resulting in energy conservation.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Meeting the requirements of the Local Pollution Control Board, in combination with the depletion of natural water resources, makes effective treatment and disposal of leftover wastewater more critical than ever.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">We at US Automation,design, construct, sell, and install fully automated Effluent Treatment Plants for a variety of industries.
