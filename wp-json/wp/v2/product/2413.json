The charged components of the paint emulsion travel to anode (AED) or cathode (CED) under electrical pressures in CED (CED). The direct current created by the bath converts the paint&#8217;s pigment and resin base into the body&#8217;s surfaces. Coating is applied to all surfaces.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">The deposited film does not disintegrate. The un-deposited material, on the other hand, is washed. For ED paint components, ultra-filtration (UF) technology is utilised to separate non-film and paint recovery. After stoning, the dislodged film hardens into a tough, long-lasting polymer film.<\/p>\n<h4>Advantages of CED Coatings<\/h4>\n<ul style=\"font-family: open sans; font-size: 14px; color: #3a3a3a;\">\n<li>Film Thickness Managed through Fully Automatic Operations<\/li>\n<li>Consistent Coating<\/li>\n<li>Better box and interior Surface Coverage<\/li>\n<li>Well-Covered Sharp Corners<\/li>\n<li>No Flows and Slumps<\/li>\n<li>No Solvents Boils<\/li>\n<li>Improved Chip and Corrosion Resistance<\/li>\n<li>Almost 100% Paint Used<\/li>\n<li>Superior Anti-pollution, Safety, and Health Hazards Protection<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Applications of CED Coatings<\/h4>\n<h5>Automotive<\/h5>\n<ul style=\"font-family: open sans; font-size: 14px; color: #3a3a3a;\">\n<li>Marine solutions<\/li>\n<li>Aerospace<\/li>\n<li>Public transportation such as trains and trams<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>Architecture &amp; Construction<\/h5>\n<ul style=\"font-family: open sans; font-size: 14px; color: #3a3a3a;\">\n<li>Building facades<\/li>\n<li>Interiors such as stainless-steel kitchen sinks<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>Industry<\/h5>\n<ul style=\"font-family: open sans; font-size: 14px; color: #3a3a3a;\">\n<li>Wind farms<\/li>\n<li>Industrial plants<\/li>\n<li>Pipelines<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text][\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2417&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">The most superior and environmentally acceptable water-based coating for metal components is cathode electro deposition.
