It is attached to CNC machine tools, such as a lathe cutting tool, and controls the location and motion of the tool. That is to say, it acts as a guide for such machining equipment. Jigs are special in that they cause the tool to become immobile when they move.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">A fixture, also known as a CNC fixture, is a popular CNC machining tool used to provide stability, support, and positioning. It functions in the same way as the jig in that it secures, supports, or mounts a workpiece on a CNC machine.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Jigs and fixtures are used to hold workpieces and machine parts in place. However, there is a distinction between the two. Turning, milling, grinding, slotting, and other multidimensional operations are all possible with these fixtures. Jigs, on the other hand, are ideal for one-dimensional operations such as counterboring, tapping, drilling, and reaming.<\/p>","protected":false},"featured_media":2679,"template":"","meta":{"_seopress_robots_primary_cat":"none","_seopress_titles_title":"Jig Fixture Manufacturer in Ahmedabad - US Automation","_seopress_titles_desc":"US Automationis the good quality Jig Fixture Manufacturer in Ahmedabad.
