The system takes hot air into the system during the summer months, cools it, and then distributes it around your home.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">Many commercial and industrial applications rely on heating and cooling coils. For more than three decades, US Automation has been designing and producing coils for quick heat transfer.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">We make heating and cooling coils for a wide range of industrial and commercial applications. Our coils are divided into three categories based on the heat transfer medium: water, steam, and refrigerant. We now provide a selection of electric heater batteries for complete heating flexibility.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">We provide a cost-effective way of extending the life of existing air plant by replacing and repairing coils in existing air handling units or ducted systems, as well as free site studies for replacement or broken coils that cannot be removed from the system.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">We&#8217;re here to help you every step of the way, with technical experience in heat transfer, a dedicated product manager, BIM objects for all coil products, and industry-leading self-selection software.<\/p>","protected":false},"featured_media":2751,"template":"","meta":{"_seopress_robots_primary_cat":"none","_seopress_titles_title":"Heating &amp; Cooling Coils Manufacturer - US Automation","_seopress_titles_desc":"US Automationhas been designing &amp; producing coils for quick heat transfer.
