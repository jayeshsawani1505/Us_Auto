ENIG produces a highly solderable, tarnish-resistant surface that also delivers excellent electrical continuity. The nickel component acts as a barrier against copper diffusion and protects the solder from contamination during soldering and rework. ENIG also provides EMI protection. This final finish procedure is corrosion-resistant and provides an excellent contacting surface.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;\">US AutomationTechnology&#8217;s ENIG technique eliminates the need for &#8220;dummy plating,&#8221; saving time and money.
