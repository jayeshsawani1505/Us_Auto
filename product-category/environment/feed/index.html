			<h3>Applications ofÂ  Water Treatment Plant</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">Water Treatment Plants have methods that improve the quality of water so that it is suitable for a certain application. Drinking water, industrial water supply, irrigation, river flow maintenance, and water leisure usage are all possible end uses, as well as being properly returned to the environment. Water treatment eliminates pollutants and unwanted components from water and reduces their concentrations so that it is suitable for its intended purpose.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Water Treatment Plant</h3>
<ul style="font-family: open sans; font-size: 14px; color: #3a3a3a;">
<li>Automated Controls</li>
<li>Simple to Use and Maintain</li>
<li>Water of Excellent Quality</li>
<li>Filtration, softening, RO, and UF, are all reusable advanced treatments.</li>
<li>Simple and Compact Design</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ultrafiltration System</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">Ultrafiltration (UF) is a pressure-driven separation technique. It is based on particle size and is guided by a screening principle. Ultra-filtration membranes with pores ranging from 0.1 to 0.01 microns in size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">The range of filtration offered by Ultra-Filtrations is in between microfiltration and nanofiltration. Ultrafiltration membranes must be cleaned on a regular basis to avoid fouling from solids, scale, and microbiological agents. Contaminants that have been separated and condensed in the UF must be disposed of.</p>
<p><u style="color: #3a3a3a;">The following are some examples of Ultra-Filtration applications:</u></p>
<ul style="color: #3a3a3a;">
<li>Wastewater and industrial process water are treated and recycled.</li>
<li>Standalone systems for the removal of particles and macromolecules</li>
<li>Filtration of effluent from paper pulp mills, chemical, pharmaceutical, food beverage, and many other industries</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reverse Osmosis (RO) Plant</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">By pushing water over a membrane, reverse osmosis is a typical method for purifying or desalinating polluted water. Reverse osmosis water can be used for a variety of things, including desalination, wastewater treatment, pollutant concentration, and dissolved mineral reclamation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">To improve the colour, taste, or characteristics of fluids, reverse osmosis is used to purify water and remove salts and other pollutants.</p>
<h3>Demineralization Plant (DM)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">Demineralization is the process of employing an ion exchange technique to remove mineral salts from water. Both cation and anion exchange resins are used in demineralization, and they are occasionally used in the same column or bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">Mineral ions such as sodium, calcium, iron, copper, and others, as well as anions such as chloride, sulphate, and nitrate, are common in water. Water that has had its mineral ions removed is known as demineralized water or deionized water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">The DM Water System uses the concepts of ion exchange, degasification, and polishing to generate mineral-free water. In the fields of steam, power, process, and cooling, the Demineralized Water System is widely used.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">Meeting the requirements of the Local Pollution Control Board, in combination with the depletion of natural water resources, makes effective treatment and disposal of leftover wastewater more critical than ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">We at US Automation,design, construct, sell, and install fully automated Effluent Treatment Plants for a variety of industries. We may also assist you in improving and modifying your existing ETP to meet the Pollution Control Board's restricting guidelines (PCB).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">Our ETP systems can remove organic, inorganic, oil and grease, heavy metals, and suspended solids from a variety of effluents and wastewater using modern physico-chemical treatments and tertiary polishing systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">US Automation offers fully automated Effluent Treatment Plants to a variety of sectors.</p>]]></description>

</ul>
<h3>Oil Skimmer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">An oil skimmer is a device that is used to remove oil from a liquid surface. It is used for a range of purposes depending on its design, including collecting fats, oils, and greases in wastewater treatment in various sectors, treating oily water, removing oil from machine tool coolants, and aqueous parts washers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">The use of oil skimmers to pre-treat effluent reduces the overall load on the ETP system and lowers the cost of cleaning the effluent. Skimmers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, including Belt, Drum, and Disk.</p>
<h3>Tube Settler</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">The Tube Settler System is a viable alternative to traditional sedimentation methods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">Tube Settlers are commonly employed to mechanically extract solid particles or suspended solids from liquids for clarifying. It&#8217;s also used to remove materials that have been deposited via sedimentation on a continual basis. Sludge is made up of concentrated pollutants that are released from the tank&#8217;s bottom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #3a3a3a;">Coagulation and flocculation reagents are given to the water before it enters the settler, allowing the solids in the settler to be separated more efficiently and simply, resulting in energy conservation.</p>
